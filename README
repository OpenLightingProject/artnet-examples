Examples provided:

 A. artnet-usb
 B. artnet-dmxconsole
 C. artnet-discover

A. artnet-usb
-------------

Usage: artnet-usb [OPTIONS] 
Acts as an ArtNet to DMX node using the Enttec Open Usb Interface

 -a <ip-address>	IP address to listen on (defaults to the address
                         of the first non loopback interface)
 -d <dmx-device>	device for dmx output (default /dev/dmx0)
 -p <port-address>	port address for output universe (default 0)
 -s <subnet-address>	subnet address for output universe (default 0)
 -v			be verbose (prints data for first four channels)

The universe address of the port is made up from the subnet address and the
port address. The four least significat bits are the port address, the four
most significat are the subnet address.

For example :

artnet-usb -p 3 -s 2

sets the universe address to 0x23

                          of the first non loopback interface)
 -p <port-address>      port address for universe (default 0)
 -s <subnet-address>    subnet address for universe (default 0)


C. artnet-discover

 -a <ip-address>        IP address to use (defaults to the address
                           of the first non loopback interface)
